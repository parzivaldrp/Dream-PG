User and Admin Panels
The project includes separate user and admin panels, each with its own set of pages and functionality.

User Panel
The user panel allows users to view and manage PGs. To access the user panel, users can log in with their credentials. Once logged in, users can:

View a list of PGs
Search for PGs
View details about each PG
Book a PG
Admin Panel
The admin panel allows administrators to manage PGs and user accounts. To access the admin panel, administrators can log in with their credentials. Once logged in, administrators can:

Add new PGs
Edit existing PGs
Delete PGs
Manage user accounts
Multi-Form Submission
The project includes a multi-form submission feature that allows administrators to enter detailed information about each PG. The form includes fields for:

PG name
Location
Facilities
And more!
Once the form is submitted, the information is stored in a database and displayed on the PG details page.

User and Admin Management
The project uses a single schema/model for both users and administrators, with an additional isAdmin field that determines whether a user is an administrator or not. This allows for easy management of user and admin roles.
